# Dewpoint Solutions' Github Apps

## About

Within this repository are the Github Apps developed by Dewpoint Solutions. Their source code is published openly to build trust.

Each is intended to be an affordable paid service: either through the Github Marketplace, or a yearly self-hosted license. The Github Marketplace version will always be powered by the code in this repository, but if you are working in a highly-sensitive codebase that requires extra protection and/or privacy, you are advised to contact us at contact@thedewpoint.com for a self-hosted license.
